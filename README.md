## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- [ ] View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- [x] See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- [x] Create, read, update, and delete boards and tasks
- [ ] Receive form validations when trying to create/edit boards and tasks
- [x] Mark subtasks as complete and move tasks between columns

- [ ] Toggle the theme between light/dark modes
- [x] **Bonus**: Allow users to drag and drop tasks to change their status and re-order them in a column

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Redux Toolkit]() - App State Management Library
- [emotion Components](https://emotion.sh/) - For styles
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Type checking

### What I learned

This project is used to learn redux toolkit state management library.

Reusable React components -
- Modal
- Dropdown Menu
- Custom Single Select

### Continued development

- [ ] **Make room to maintain multiple modals.**<br>
  Example - In View Task Modal, delete task action triggers the confirmation modal(dialog). The cancel action of the confirmation modal should restore the View Task Modal with any updates if applicable.

- [ ] **Add animations in the app.**
